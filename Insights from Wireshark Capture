## Insights from Wireshark Capture

### 1. **Packet Capture Overview**
The Wireshark capture contains network traffic from a small local network, including normal traffic and potential indicators of malicious behavior. The objective was to analyze various protocols, detect anomalies, and examine potential security risks.

**Capture Details:**
- **Capture Duration:** 1 hour
- **Protocols Involved:** HTTP, DNS, ICMP, TCP, UDP
- **Traffic Volume:** 500 MB

### 2. **High-Level Insights**
- **Unusual DNS Requests:** A significant number of DNS queries were made to an external domain (`malicious-example.com`), which did not match any internal configurations. This behavior can indicate DNS tunneling or exfiltration attempts.
- **Potential DoS Attack:** An unusually high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (ping) was observed from a single host, potentially indicating a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
- **Suspicious HTTP Traffic:** Multiple HTTP requests with an unusual User-Agent string and accessing paths related to `"/wp-admin"` were detected, potentially indicating automated scanning for vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Detailed Packet Analysis**

#### A. **Suspicious DNS Requests**
- **Timestamp:** 12:02:15
- **Source IP:** 192.168.1.45
- **Destination IP:** 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)
- **Query:** `malicious-example.com`
- **Analysis:**
  - This DNS request was made to an external DNS server, suggesting an attempt to resolve a potentially malicious domain. It is uncommon for internal devices to make requests for external domains outside the expected whitelist.
  - **Action:** Investigate the device (192.168.1.45) for signs of malware or unauthorized tunneling tools.

#### B. **Possible DDoS Attack (ICMP Flood)**
- **Timestamp Range:** 12:10:00 - 12:15:30
- **Source IP:** 10.0.0.5
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.1.10
- **Protocol:** ICMP
- **Type:** Echo Request (ping)
- **Count:** 200+ requests in 5 minutes
- **Analysis:**
  - A flood of ICMP Echo Requests was observed from IP 10.0.0.5, targeting a single internal machine (192.168.1.10).
  - **Action:** Configure rate-limiting for ICMP traffic or block suspicious IPs through the firewall.

#### C. **Suspicious HTTP Traffic (Possible Brute Force)**
- **Timestamp:** 12:20:45
- **Source IP:** 192.168.1.50
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.1.100
- **Protocol:** HTTP
- **Request Path:** `/wp-admin`
- **User-Agent:** `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/111.0.0.0 Safari/537.36`
- **Analysis:**
  - Repeated HTTP requests to a WordPress admin page (often targeted by automated bots attempting brute-force attacks).
  - The User-Agent string is generic, matching many automated scanners.
  - **Action:** Implement rate-limiting or CAPTCHA on login pages and ensure that WordPress is updated and secured.

### 4. **Conclusion and Recommendations**
- **DNS Traffic:** There was an unusual spike in external DNS queries to a suspicious domain, warranting further investigation into possible malware infection or exfiltration.
- **ICMP Flooding:** A potential DoS attack was detected, suggesting that defensive measures (e.g., firewalls or DDoS mitigation tools) should be deployed.
- **HTTP Brute Force Attempts:** Automated tools might be probing the internal network for vulnerabilities. Harden the web server, use strong authentication mechanisms, and monitor login attempts.

### 5. **Next Steps**
- Implement alerts for suspicious DNS requests.
- Review firewall rules and increase protections against DDoS traffic.
- Strengthen HTTP security measures for web applications, particularly those facing the internet.
