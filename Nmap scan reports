### Example 1: **Basic Nmap Scan**

This scan checks which ports are open on a target system.

```bash
$ nmap 192.168.1.1

Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-11-25 12:45 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0010s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
443/tcp  open  https
8080/tcp open  http-proxy
MAC Address: 00:14:22:01:23:45 (Cisco Systems)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.09 seconds
```

**Explanation:**
- This is a simple Nmap scan targeting the IP `192.168.1.1`.
- Nmap identifies that the host is up and reports open ports such as SSH (22/tcp), HTTP (80/tcp), HTTPS (443/tcp), and HTTP Proxy (8080/tcp).
- The MAC address of the target device is also reported.

### Example 2: **Service Version Detection**

This scan tries to detect the version of the services running on open ports.

```bash
$ nmap -sV 192.168.1.1

Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-11-25 12:50 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0010s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))
443/tcp  open  https   Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))
8080/tcp open  http-proxy Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))
MAC Address: 00:14:22:01:23:45 (Cisco Systems)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 6.12 seconds
```

**Explanation:**
- The `-sV` flag enables version detection. The output lists the versions of services running on open ports.
- In this example, Apache HTTPD version 2.4.38 and OpenSSH 7.9p1 are identified.
- Knowing the service versions can help identify vulnerabilities if they are outdated.

### Example 3: **OS Detection**

This scan attempts to detect the operating system (OS) of the target.

```bash
$ nmap -O 192.168.1.1

Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-11-25 12:55 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0010s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
443/tcp  open  https
8080/tcp open  http-proxy
MAC Address: 00:14:22:01:23:45 (Cisco Systems)

OS fingerprint not available because the target is being evaded.

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.11 seconds
```

**Explanation:**
- The `-O` flag enables OS detection. 
- However, the OS fingerprinting failed due to the target using evasion techniques (e.g., firewall rules or packet filtering).
- Nmap could not determine the operating system, but it still provides information about open ports.

### Example 4: **Aggressive Scan**

An aggressive scan performs multiple tests, including version detection, OS detection, and script scanning.

```bash
$ nmap -A 192.168.1.1

Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-11-25 13:00 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0010s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))
443/tcp  open  https   Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))
8080/tcp open  http-proxy Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))

Host script results:
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.38 (Debian)

MAC Address: 00:14:22:01:23:45 (Cisco Systems)

OS details: Linux 3.2 - 4.9

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.87 seconds
```

**Explanation:**
- The `-A` flag enables aggressive scanning, which includes version detection, OS detection, and script scanning.
- The output shows the versions of services, the operating system (`Linux 3.2 - 4.9`), and additional information from Nmap scripts, such as the HTTP server details and title.

### Example 5: **TCP SYN Scan (Stealth Scan)**

A SYN scan is a stealthy method to identify open ports without establishing a full TCP connection.

```bash
$ nmap -sS 192.168.1.1

Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-11-25 13:05 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0010s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
443/tcp  open  https
8080/tcp open  http-proxy
MAC Address: 00:14:22:01:23:45 (Cisco Systems)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 4.52 seconds
```

**Explanation:**
- The `-sS` flag performs a TCP SYN scan, which is stealthier than a full TCP connect scan. 
- The scan reports the same open ports as before but uses fewer system resources and leaves less trace on the target system compared to a regular scan.
