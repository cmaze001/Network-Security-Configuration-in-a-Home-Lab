Explanation:
No.: Packet number in the capture.
Time: The time relative to the start of the capture.
Source: The source IP address initiating the communication (e.g., 192.168.1.10).
Destination: The destination IP address receiving the communication (e.g., 192.168.1.20).
Protocol: The protocol used for the communication, such as TCP or HTTP.
Length: The size of the packet in bytes.
Info: The packet-specific information, such as the type of message (e.g., SYN, GET request, etc.).
Breakdown of Key Packets:
SYN Packet (Packet 1): The client (192.168.1.10) sends a TCP SYN packet to initiate a connection to port 443 (HTTPS) on the server (192.168.1.20).
SYN-ACK (Packet 2): The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, confirming the connection request.
ACK (Packet 3): The client acknowledges the server’s SYN-ACK, completing the handshake.
HTTP GET Request (Packet 4): The client sends an HTTP GET request to fetch the page /index.html from the server.
HTTP 200 OK Response (Packet 5): The server responds with a 200 OK message, indicating that the GET request was successfully processed and the page is sent.
FIN-ACK (Packets 6 and 7): Both the client and the server send TCP FIN packets to close the connection.
